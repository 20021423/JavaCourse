**Knowledge Area:** Entity, Annotations (@Id)

**Question 8:** What is the purpose of `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` in JPA Entities?
a) To manually set the primary key value
b) To indicate that the primary key is a foreign key
c) To specify that the database will automatically generate primary key values using an identity column
d) To define a composite primary key

**Correct Answer:** c) To specify that the database will automatically generate primary key values using an identity column

**Explanation:** `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` configures primary key generation to rely on the database's identity column feature for auto-incrementing primary keys, commonly used in databases like MySQL and SQL Server.

**Knowledge Area:** Entity, Annotations (@GeneratedValue), Primary Key Generation

**Question 9:**  If you have a `Student` entity and a `StudentRepository` extending `JpaRepository<Student, Long>`, which method would you use in `StudentRepository` to retrieve a student by their ID?
a) `getStudentById(Long id)`
b) `fetchStudent(Long id)`
c) `findById(Long id)`
d) `retrieveStudent(Long id)`

**Correct Answer:** c) `findById(Long id)`

**Knowledge Area:** Repository (Spring Data JPA), CRUD Operations (Read), `JpaRepository` methods

**Question 10:**  If you want to add a custom query to `StudentRepository` to find students whose names contain a specific keyword, which naming convention for the method name would Spring Data JPA understand to generate the query automatically?
a) `searchByName(String keyword)`
b) `getNameByKeyword(String keyword)`
c) `findByNameContaining(String keyword)`
d) `queryNameWithKeyword(String keyword)`

**Correct Answer:** c) `findByNameContaining(String keyword)`

**Explanation:** Spring Data JPA supports query derivation from method names. `findByNameContaining(String keyword)` follows the naming convention to automatically generate a query that finds entities where the 'name' field contains the given 'keyword'.

**Knowledge Area:** Repository (Spring Data JPA), Query Methods, Query Derivation

**Question 11:**  Which method of `JpaRepository` is used to save a new entity or update an existing one?
a) `create(Entity entity)`
b) `update(Entity entity)`
c) `save(Entity entity)`
d) `persist(Entity entity)`

**Correct Answer:** c) `save(Entity entity)`

**Explanation:** The `save(entity)` method in `JpaRepository` is used for both creating new entities (if the entity's ID is null or not set) and updating existing entities (if the entity's ID is already present and exists in the database).

**Knowledge Area:** Repository (Spring Data JPA), CRUD Operations (Create, Update), `JpaRepository` methods

**Question 12:** What is the return type of `findById(ID id)` method in `JpaRepository`?
a) `Student`
b) `List<Student>`
c) `Optional<Student>`
d) `void`

**Correct Answer:** c) `Optional<Student>`

**Explanation:** `findById(ID id)` returns `Optional<Student>` to handle cases where an entity with the given ID might not exist. Using `Optional` forces the caller to explicitly handle the possibility of a null result.

**Knowledge Area:** Repository (Spring Data JPA), `JpaRepository` methods, `Optional`

**Question 13:** To delete a `Student` entity by its ID using `StudentRepository`, which method would you call?
a) `removeStudentById(Long id)`
b) `deleteStudent(Long id)`
c) `eraseById(Long id)`
d) `deleteById(Long id)`

**Correct Answer:** d) `deleteById(Long id)`

**Explanation:** `JpaRepository` provides the `deleteById(ID id)` method for deleting an entity based on its primary key ID.

**Question 16:** Explain the relationship between JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA.
a) JPA is an ORM framework; Hibernate is a specification; Spring Data JPA is a Spring module that uses JPA implementations.
b) JPA is a specification; Hibernate is an implementation of JPA; Spring Data JPA simplifies the use of JPA implementations like Hibernate in Spring applications.
c) Hibernate is a specification; JPA is an implementation; Spring Data JPA replaces both JPA and Hibernate.
d) Spring Data JPA is a specification; JPA and Hibernate are implementations of Spring Data JPA.

**Correct Answer:** b) JPA is a specification; Hibernate is an implementation of JPA; Spring Data JPA simplifies the use of JPA implementations like Hibernate in Spring applications.

**Explanation:** JPA (Java Persistence API) defines the standard interface for ORM in Java. Hibernate is a popular ORM framework that implements the JPA specification. Spring Data JPA is a Spring module that leverages JPA implementations (like Hibernate) to provide a simplified and streamlined way to perform data access operations in Spring applications, reducing boilerplate code.

**Knowledge Area:** JPA and Hibernate, Spring Data JPA

**Question 17:** When performing an update operation using `JpaRepository.save(entity)`, how does Spring Data JPA determine whether to perform an INSERT or an UPDATE?
a) It checks if the entity is new by examining all fields; if all are default values, it's an INSERT, otherwise UPDATE.
b) It checks if an entity with the same ID already exists in the database; if yes, it's an UPDATE, otherwise INSERT.
c) It always performs an UPDATE and throws an exception if the entity does not exist.
d) It always performs an INSERT and throws an exception if the entity already exists.

**Correct Answer:** b) It checks if an entity with the same ID already exists in the database; if yes, it's an UPDATE, otherwise INSERT.

**Explanation:** When `JpaRepository.save(entity)` is called, Spring Data JPA checks if the entity has a non-null ID. If the ID is null or not set (for auto-generated IDs and for certain ID generation strategies it might check existence in database), it performs an INSERT. If the ID is present and an entity with that ID exists in the database, it performs an UPDATE.

**Knowledge Area:** Repository (Spring Data JPA), CRUD Operations (Create, Update), `JpaRepository.save()`

**Question 18:**  Describe a scenario where you would need to define a custom query in a Spring Data JPA repository instead of relying on query derivation from method names.
a) When you need to perform a simple CRUD operation.
b) When you need to retrieve all entities of a certain type.
c) When you need to perform a complex query that cannot be easily expressed through method name conventions, such as queries involving joins, native SQL, or complex conditions.
d) Query derivation is always sufficient; custom queries are never needed.

**Correct Answer:** c) When you need to perform a complex query that cannot be easily expressed through method name conventions, such as queries involving joins, native SQL, or complex conditions.

**Explanation:** While query derivation is powerful for many common queries, custom queries are needed for more complex scenarios that cannot be easily derived from method names. This includes queries with joins across multiple tables, using native SQL for database-specific features, or implementing very specific or intricate filtering conditions.

**Knowledge Area:** Repository (Spring Data JPA), Query Methods, Custom Queries, `@Query`

**Question 19:** How can you define a custom query in a Spring Data JPA repository?
a) By overriding the default CRUD methods in the repository interface.
b) By using XML configuration to declare queries.
c) By using the `@Query` annotation on repository methods and specifying JPQL or native SQL.
d) Custom queries are not supported in Spring Data JPA.

**Correct Answer:** c) By using the `@Query` annotation on repository methods and specifying JPQL or native SQL.

**Explanation:** Spring Data JPA allows defining custom queries using the `@Query` annotation. You can write either JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) queries, which are database-independent and operate on entities, or native SQL queries for more database-specific operations and performance optimizations.

**Knowledge Area:** Repository (Spring Data JPA), Query Methods, Custom Queries, `@Query`

**Question 20:** What are the implications of setting `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop`?
a) It updates the schema without dropping it at the end of the session.
b) It creates the database schema when the application starts and drops it when the application context is closed.
c) It only creates the schema if it does not exist and keeps it after the session.
d) It disables schema management entirely.

**Correct Answer:** b) It creates the database schema when the application starts and drops it when the application context is closed.

**Explanation:** `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop` is useful primarily for testing or development environments. It instructs Hibernate to create the database schema at application startup and, importantly, drop the schema and data when the application context is closed. This is ideal for ensuring a clean state for each test run but is highly unsuitable for production due to data loss.

**Question 21:**  Explain the concept of JPA Entities and their role in ORM.
a) JPA Entities are JavaScript objects used for frontend validation.
b) JPA Entities are Java classes that represent database tables, enabling ORM by mapping classes to tables and object properties to table columns.
c) JPA Entities are XML configuration files defining database connections.
d) JPA Entities are database stored procedures.

**Correct Answer:** b) JPA Entities are Java classes that represent database tables, enabling ORM by mapping classes to tables and object properties to table columns.

**Explanation:** JPA Entities are central to Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). They are plain Java classes annotated to define how they map to relational database tables. Each entity instance represents a row in a table, and entity fields map to table columns. This mapping allows developers to work with data as objects in Java code, while JPA and Hibernate handle the translation to database operations.

**Knowledge Area:** Entity, JPA and Hibernate, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

**Question 22:**  Describe the typical layers in a Spring application that interacts with a database using Spring Data JPA, from the web request to the database operation.
a) Controller -> View -> Repository -> Database
b) Controller -> Service -> Entity -> Database
c) Controller -> Service -> Repository -> JPA/Hibernate -> Database
d) Controller -> Repository -> Entity -> Database

**Correct Answer:** c) Controller -> Service -> Repository -> JPA/Hibernate -> Database

**Explanation:** In a typical layered Spring application:
    *   **Controller:** Handles web requests and interacts with the Service layer.
    *   **Service:** Contains business logic and orchestrates operations, often using Repositories.
    *   **Repository (Spring Data JPA):** Provides data access methods, using JPA/Hibernate under the hood.
    *   **JPA/Hibernate:** ORM framework that translates repository operations into database-specific SQL queries.
    *   **Database:** Actual relational database where data is stored and retrieved.

**Knowledge Area:** Spring Application Layers, Controller, Service, Repository, JPA/Hibernate

**Question 23:** What are some advantages of using Spring Data JPA over traditional JDBC for database interactions in Spring?
a) JDBC is faster and more efficient for all types of database operations.
b) Spring Data JPA reduces boilerplate code, simplifies CRUD operations, provides query derivation, and offers abstraction from database-specific SQL, improving developer productivity and code maintainability.
c) JDBC is easier to configure and requires less setup than Spring Data JPA.
d) Spring Data JPA only supports a limited number of databases, while JDBC supports all databases.

**Correct Answer:** b) Spring Data JPA reduces boilerplate code, simplifies CRUD operations, provides query derivation, and offers abstraction from database-specific SQL, improving developer productivity and code maintainability.

**Explanation:** Spring Data JPA offers significant advantages over traditional JDBC, including: reduced boilerplate for common data access operations (CRUD), automatic repository implementation, query derivation from method names, and abstraction from vendor-specific SQL, leading to increased developer productivity, cleaner code, and easier maintenance. While JDBC provides low-level control and can be performant for highly optimized queries, it requires significantly more manual coding for typical data access tasks.

**Very Hard Level**

**Question 24:**  Discuss the differences between using `@Query` with JPQL versus native SQL in Spring Data JPA repositories. When would you choose one over the other?
a) JPQL is database-specific; native SQL is database-independent. Use native SQL for simple queries and JPQL for complex ones.
b) JPQL is database-independent, operating on entities and their relationships; native SQL is database-specific, allowing raw SQL queries. Choose JPQL for portability and ORM benefits, native SQL for performance optimization or database-specific features.
c) JPQL and native SQL are interchangeable; JPQL is just a newer syntax for native SQL.
d) Native SQL is deprecated; JPQL is the only recommended way to write custom queries in Spring Data JPA.

**Correct Answer:** b) JPQL is database-independent, operating on entities and their relationships; native SQL is database-specific, allowing raw SQL queries. Choose JPQL for portability and ORM benefits, native SQL for performance optimization or database-specific features.

**Explanation:** JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) is ORM-centric and database-agnostic. It operates on entities and their relationships, providing portability across different databases. Native SQL is database-specific, allows you to write raw SQL queries, and can be necessary for performance tuning, using database-specific features, or accessing database constructs not easily represented in JPA entities. Choose JPQL for most cases to maintain database independence and leverage ORM benefits; use native SQL when necessary for performance or specific database features, understanding the trade-off in portability.

**Knowledge Area:** Repository (Spring Data JPA), Custom Queries, `@Query`, JPQL vs Native SQL

**Question 25:** Explain the concept of 'Entity Lifecycle' in JPA and how Hibernate manages entity states (e.g., transient, persistent, detached).
a) Entity Lifecycle refers to the time an entity exists in memory; Hibernate only manages 'persistent' state.
b) Entity Lifecycle describes the different states an entity can be in during its interaction with JPA provider; Hibernate manages states like transient (new), persistent (managed by EntityManager), and detached (not managed, but with DB identity).
c) Entity Lifecycle is managed by Spring Container, not Hibernate; states are 'created' and 'destroyed'.
d) Entity Lifecycle is only relevant for NoSQL databases, not relational databases with JPA/Hibernate.

**Correct Answer:** b) Entity Lifecycle describes the different states an entity can be in during its interaction with JPA provider; Hibernate manages states like transient (new), persistent (managed by EntityManager), and detached (not managed, but with DB identity).

**Explanation:** The JPA Entity Lifecycle defines the different states an entity can be in during its interaction with a JPA provider like Hibernate. Key states include:
    *   **Transient:** New entity, not yet associated with a persistence context or database.
    *   **Persistent (Managed):** Entity is associated with a persistence context (EntityManager) and tracked for changes. Changes to persistent entities are automatically synchronized with the database during transaction commit.
    *   **Detached:** Entity was once persistent but is no longer associated with an EntityManager. Changes are not automatically tracked or persisted.
Hibernate manages these states and transitions between them during operations like persist, merge, remove, and detach. Understanding entity lifecycle is crucial for efficient and correct data management with JPA and Hibernate.

**Question 26:**  Discuss the trade-offs and considerations when choosing between different `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` values (e.g., `none`, `update`, `create`, `create-drop`) in different environments (development, testing, production).
a) `create-drop` is best for production; `none` for development; `update` for testing. No trade-offs, just environment-specific best practices.
b) `none` for all environments for security reasons; manual schema management is always required.
c) `create-drop` is convenient for development/testing for schema reset but dangerous for production (data loss); `update` is useful for development schema evolution but risky in production; `none` for production for schema stability, requiring managed schema migrations. Trade-offs involve convenience vs. data integrity and schema stability.
d) `update` is the safest for all environments; others are for specialized cases only.

**Correct Answer:** c) `create-drop` is convenient for development/testing for schema reset but dangerous for production (data loss); `update` is useful for development schema evolution but risky in production; `none` for production for schema stability, requiring managed schema migrations. Trade-offs involve convenience vs. data integrity and schema stability.

**Explanation:**
    *   **`create-drop`**: Convenient for development and automated testing as it ensures a clean database schema at the start of each session, but it leads to data loss upon application shutdown, making it extremely dangerous for production.
    *   **`create`**: Creates schema on startup but doesn't drop it on shutdown. Better for development than `create-drop` but still not suitable for production.
    *   **`update`**: Attempts to update the schema to match entities. Useful in development for schema evolution but can be risky in production as Hibernate's schema update might not be perfect or could lead to unintended data changes or loss in complex schema evolutions.
    *   **`none`**: Disables automatic schema management. Best practice for production. Schema migrations should be managed separately using dedicated tools (like Flyway or Liquibase) to ensure controlled, versioned, and safe schema changes.

Choosing `ddl-auto` values involves trade-offs between development convenience (automatic schema management) and production stability and data integrity (manual, managed schema migrations). Production environments typically use `none` and rely on managed database migration processes.

**Question 27:**  Discuss different strategies for handling database transactions in Spring applications using Spring Data JPA.
a) Transactions are only managed manually using JDBC; Spring Data JPA does not handle transactions.
b) Spring Data JPA repositories are transactional by default; additional transaction management is not needed.
c) Spring Data JPA provides default transaction management for repository methods. For more complex, multi-repository operations, you can use `@Transactional` annotation to define transactional boundaries, controlling transaction propagation and isolation levels.
d) Transactions are managed only at the database level; Spring does not provide transaction management features for JPA.

**Correct Answer:** c) Spring Data JPA provides default transaction management for repository methods. For more complex, multi-repository operations, you can use `@Transactional` annotation to define transactional boundaries, controlling transaction propagation and isolation levels.

**Explanation:** Spring Data JPA repositories are by default transactional. Simple CRUD operations from `JpaRepository` methods are executed within a transaction. For more complex operations that span multiple repository calls or involve custom business logic requiring transactional integrity, you should use Spring's `@Transactional` annotation. `@Transactional` can be applied at the service layer (or even controller layer in simpler applications) to define transactional boundaries, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) for operations involving database interactions. You can also configure transaction propagation and isolation levels through `@Transactional` annotation attributes.

**Knowledge Area:** Transactions, Spring Data JPA, `@Transactional`, Transaction Management

**Question 28:**  Explain how to implement optimistic locking using JPA annotations to prevent concurrent modification conflicts.
a) Optimistic locking is automatically enabled by default in JPA; no annotations are needed.
b) Use `@Version` annotation on an entity field to enable optimistic locking. JPA will automatically handle version checking during updates to prevent concurrent modifications.
c) Optimistic locking is implemented using database triggers, not JPA annotations.
d) Optimistic locking is not supported in JPA; pessimistic locking must be used instead.

**Correct Answer:** b) Use `@Version` annotation on an entity field to enable optimistic locking. JPA will automatically handle version checking during updates to prevent concurrent modifications.

**Explanation:** To implement optimistic locking in JPA, you annotate a field in your entity (typically an integer or timestamp field) with `@Version`. This field will act as a version counter. When an entity is updated, JPA checks if the version number in the database matches the version number of the entity being updated. If they match, the update proceeds, and the version number is incremented. If they don't match (indicating concurrent modification), a `OptimisticLockException` is thrown, preventing data corruption due to concurrent updates.

**Knowledge Area:** Optimistic Locking, Concurrency Control, JPA Annotations (`@Version`)

**Question 29:**  Discuss strategies for optimizing performance when working with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate, especially concerning common issues like N+1 select problem.
a) Performance optimization is not needed with Spring Data JPA; it is automatically optimized. N+1 problem does not exist in JPA/Hibernate.
b) Use lazy loading for all relationships and disable caching to ensure data consistency; N+1 problem is solved by disabling caching.
c) Strategies include: using eager loading judiciously (or `JOIN FETCH` in JPQL) to avoid N+1 selects, enabling and configuring second-level caching, using appropriate indexing in database, and optimizing queries (e.g., using projections, DTOs to fetch only necessary data). N+1 select problem is a common performance issue in ORM and needs to be addressed with eager loading or fetch joins.
d) Only solution for performance issues is to switch to native SQL queries and bypass JPA/Hibernate. Caching and eager loading are not effective.

**Correct Answer:** c) Strategies include: using eager loading judiciously (or `JOIN FETCH` in JPQL) to avoid N+1 selects, enabling and configuring second-level caching, using appropriate indexing in database, and optimizing queries (e.g., using projections, DTOs to fetch only necessary data). N+1 select problem is a common performance issue in ORM and needs to be addressed with eager loading or fetch joins.

**Explanation:** Optimizing performance with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate involves several strategies:
    *   **Addressing N+1 Select Problem:**  This common ORM issue occurs when lazy-loaded relationships lead to multiple (N+1) queries instead of a single efficient join query. Solutions include using eager loading (fetch type EAGER, use with caution), or using `JOIN FETCH` in JPQL queries to fetch related entities in the initial query.
    *   **Enabling and Configuring Caching:** Hibernate's second-level cache (and first-level cache within Session/EntityManager) can significantly reduce database load by caching frequently accessed entities. Proper cache configuration and invalidation strategies are crucial.
    *   **Database Indexing:** Ensure appropriate indexes are created in the database for columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses.
    *   **Query Optimization:** Optimize JPQL or native SQL queries. Use projections or Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to fetch only the data needed instead of fetching entire entities when not necessary.

**Question 30:**  Describe how to set up and use an embedded database like H2 for Spring Boot applications, especially for development and testing. What are the benefits and limitations?
a) H2 cannot be used with Spring Boot; only external databases are supported.
b) To use H2, just add H2 dependency and Spring Boot auto-configures it; H2 is suitable for production.
c) To use H2, add H2 dependency and configure `spring.datasource.url` to `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` (or file path) in `application.properties`. Benefits: ease of setup, in-memory or file-based, good for dev/test. Limitations: not as feature-rich or performant as production databases, in-memory DB is volatile.
d) H2 is only for read-only operations; not suitable for CRUD applications.

**Correct Answer:** c) To use H2, add H2 dependency and configure `spring.datasource.url` to `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` (or file path) in `application.properties`. Benefits: ease of setup, in-memory or file-based, good for dev/test. Limitations: not as feature-rich or performant as production databases, in-memory DB is volatile.

**Explanation:**  To use H2 embedded database in Spring Boot:
    1.  **Add H2 Dependency:** Include the H2 database dependency in your `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle).
    2.  **Configure `application.properties`:** Set `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` for an in-memory database (data is lost on application stop) or `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:./data/testdb` for a file-based database (data persists in a file). You might also need to configure username and password. Spring Boot auto-configures DataSource based on these properties.

**Benefits of H2:**
    *   **Ease of Setup:** No separate database server installation required; embedded within the application.
    *   **In-Memory Option:** Very fast for testing, provides a clean state for each test.
    *   **File-Based Option:** Data persistence in a local file.
    *   **Good for Development and Testing:** Quick setup and teardown, isolated testing environment.

**Limitations of H2:**
    *   **Not Production-Grade:** Not as robust, scalable, or feature-rich as full-fledged database servers like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
    *   **In-Memory Volatility:** In-memory databases lose data when the application stops.

H2 is an excellent choice for development and testing purposes, simplifying setup and providing isolation, but production environments should use more robust, external database servers.
